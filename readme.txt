Name: Movie trailer project

Version: 1.2

System requirements: Python 2.7.10

Description: this is a small program created to complete the first project of Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree july 2015. It's been developed with python 2.7.10. It creates an html page with a couple of titles, posters and storylines of some movies and if you click on any movie, you'll see the trailer.

Instructions: to run the program, you'll need to have python installed, download movie.zip and unzip it. Open python IDLE and open "entertainment_center.py". Finally, run that file.

Changes from previuos version: I have fixed some issues to be ble to follow the Python style guide, some html structure problems and adding the storyline text in .txt files to keep the code simple to read.
